# üè° AirBnB Clone Full-Stack Web Application

## Overview

This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform **AirBnB**. The goal is to build a functional and responsive web application that allows users to:

- Browse property listings
- View detailed property information
- Complete secure bookings

The project will cover **frontend development**, **backend APIs**, **database design**, and **deployment**.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
- **Design Tools:** Figma for UI/UX design

## Key Features

- **Property search and filtering**
- **Detailed property viewing**
- **Secure checkout process**
- **User authentication**

Primary Pages

### Importance of identifying design properties of a mock up design

1. Clarity of Vision and Intent.

- Design properties (like color, typography, spacing, layout, and visual hierarchy) help communicate the designer‚Äôs vision.

2. Consistency in Implementation.

- Identifying design properties early allows for the creation of consistent UI elements (buttons, headers, forms, etc.).

- It leads to the development of design systems or style guides, which reduce errors and visual discrepancies.

3. Improved Developer Handoff.

- Developers need exact design specs: colors (HEX/RGB codes), font sizes, padding, margins, component behaviors, etc.

- Properly identified properties make it easier to translate designs into code accurately and efficiently.

4. Facilitates Feedback and Iteration.

- Clear design properties make it easier to evaluate a mock-up and provide targeted feedback.

- Helps teams iterate quickly, as they can pinpoint which aspect (e.g., typography or layout) needs adjustment.

5. Supports Responsive and Accessible Design.

- Understanding layout and component behaviors allows for better planning for responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop).

- Helps in addressing accessibility needs ‚Äî like contrast ratios, font sizes, and readable typefaces ‚Äî early in the design process.

6. Foundation for Prototyping and Testing.

- Identified design properties make interactive prototypes more realistic and testable.

- Usability testing becomes more accurate when designs reflect the final look and feel.
